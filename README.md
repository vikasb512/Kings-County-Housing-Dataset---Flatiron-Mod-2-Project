## Kings-County-Housing-Dataset---Flatiron-Mod-2-Project

As an Analyst for a REIT, our goal in this project was to identify factors that affect home prices. Through this project we are looking to predict house prices for other counties, by creating a regression model from the King's County Data.

#### Project Results / Conclusion

As you go through the notebook, you will see that we looked at several variables and tried to determine how they affect housing prices. Below are key pointers:

We conducted tests on 4 different Models of Linear Multiple Regression. Following an Iterative modeling process, we got the following results from our final model:
1. R-Squared: 0.946
2. Adjusted R-Squared: 0.946
3. P-values: All variables have P-values less than 0.05
4. RMSE Results: 
    4.1 Avg. Residual: 121076; 
    4.2 Standard Deviation: 1968
5. Q-Q Plot Results:The Model might need further refinement to be used for higher priced homes.

#### Key Takeaways:

Every 1 unit increase in the sqft of a house results in an increase of approx. $98 in the price of the house.
Sqft of the plot does not seem to have a significant impact on the price of the houses. However, this needs to be further explored for accuracy.
Future/Next Steps:
The Model will need further analysis as their are variables that were left our during this project, such as the neighborhood data. It would be a good exercise to check how pricing changes depending on the location in a specific area.
